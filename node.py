# ## Node

# Each node of the binary tree should be an instance of your `Node` class.  Create this class with the following fields:

# 1. `key` - the key the item is stored under.  The placement of the node in the tree is based on this key.
# 1. `value` - the value being stored (string or object is fine).
# 1. `parent` - a reference to the parent of the node.
# 1. `left` - a reference to the left child of the node.
# 1. `right` - a reference to the right child of the node.
